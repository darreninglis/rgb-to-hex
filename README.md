# RGB - HEX Converter.

## Description

I built this after wondering how RGB and HEX colours work in web development. It is based off a YouTube tutorial but I then refactored it with SASS.

## Tech Stack

- HTML 5
- SASS
- Google web fonts

## What I Learned

This was a great way to learn about the RGB and HEX values we use every day in web development. Combining this SASS was just amazing.
